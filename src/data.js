      title: "Reading PGN from the DGT Electronic Chessboard",
      tags: [1],
      date: "2021-06-20",
      content: `The DGT Electronic Chess Board is capable of recording any games played on it into internal memory.  Each piece emits a 
      faint RFID signal and the board contains a mesh sensor that detects the presence of any pieces placed on top of it.  The piece needs to be directly 
      on top of a square for the move to register.  In rare cases the board can register ghost pieces and from radio interference.  The data on the board can be read 
      by a chess program like Fritz or can be simply written to disk for archiving or future analysis.  DGT releases a few programs along with the board
       that are supposed to make connecting the board to your computer easy.  RabbitQueen is helpful for dumping the board memory (readonly) and configuring   
      internal parameters.  RabbitConnect and RabbitPlugin allow you to connect the board to chess programs like Fritz.  
      
      Of the programs DGT provides, LiveChess is the most interesting.  It is used capture the live games played by multiple DGT boards 
      and can write them to disk or stream them on the LiveChess cloud.  The file written to disk will update as the games progresses.  It
      can be read by online chess services like Lichess or by anyone who wants to parse this data.  I imagine there are folks out there who 
      read the pgn as is and can reconstruct the game in their head like Beth Harmon in The Queen's Gambit.
      
      Thanks to the number of chess libraries on Github it is easy to parse a pgn file.  Python-chess seems like the most feature rich open source project. It 
      has a ton of contributors and integrates with Polyglot, Syzeyg, and Stockfish easily.  It also has methods for traversing variations of the Pgn as a tree 
      which would be useful for game analysis. If you prefer javascript, chess.js a great choice too.  It has everything needed to do fun things with Pgn files 
      and that's what we'll use in the code below.`

      title: "UnityWebRequest and Tmp_Dropdown:  Making a dynamic dropdown in Unity",
      tags: [3],
      date: "2021-06-20",
      content: `When putting together a GUI in Unity you may need a dropdown and you don't know the value of the options 
      until the menu is used.  For example if the values need to come from a web request you may not want to make that request until 
      the menu is clicked.  To do this we'll need to use two classes built into Unity, UnityWebRequest and JsonUtility.   UnityWebRequest 
      is used to make the network request and JsonUtility is used to serialize the response into a class that exposes the values from the response.

      tags: [3],

      content: `If you've used discord you probably know there are discord bots for everything.  There are bots for playing music, gambling, managing roles and 
      about anything else that seems remotely useful.  This is probably because making a discord bot is pretty straightforward using discord.js.

      content: `A recent humble bundle for front end development contained the last press of O'Reilly book Learning React.  Although you can run pure React by including react from 
      the CDN, it's common to use a toolchain to bring together a full ecosystems of packages that make developing with React easier.
