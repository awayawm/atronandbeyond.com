Do you like chess?  I'm not any good at it, but I do enjoy watching a good chess game.
Nowadays, it's easy to find good chess online.  Big tournaments are streamed and include ESPN level
commentary.  Over the summer I faithfully tracked the games of the <Link href='https://grandchesstour.org/' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Grand Chess Tour</Link>
and was not disappointed.  Watching all of this good chess got me thinking about the data behind a chess game and
how that data can be used to do cool things.

Electronic chess boards or e-boards store moves in their memory and can interface with a computer.  The particular board I was able to get
my hands on, the <Link href='https://www.dgtnorthamerica.com/eboards' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">DGT Electronic Chess Board</Link>,
can write these moves to disk in about 3 seconds after the move occurs. Each piece emits a faint RFID signal and the board contains a
mesh sensor that detects the presence of any pieces placed on top of it.  The piece needs to be directly on top of a square
for the move to register. The details how the board stores the moves and reconstructs the game is beyond me, but as long as valid
moves are played it seems to work reliably.

</Typography>

In the above picture we have a DGT e-board with a serial connection to a PC through a USB to RS-232 adapter.  The
RJ-45 connector is for daisy chaining multiple boards together.  There's also a free connector that looks like a
headphone jack that plugs into a game clock like the <Link href='https://www.dgtnorthamerica.com/dgt-3000'>DGT-3000</Link>
but it isn't required.  If it is plugged in though the clock value for each move will be included as a comment in the PGN.
The cable going off the image in the bottom-left corner is for the power adapter.

DGT has released a few programs along with the board that includes drivers, debugging software and software to manage the output of
one or more boards.  <Link href='https://digitalgametechnology.com/faq/software-downloads/rabbitqueen-software' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">RabbitQueen</Link> is
helpful for dumping the board memory (readonly) and configuring internal parameters.  <Link href='https://digitalgametechnology.com/faq/software-downloads/rabbitplugin-software' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">RabbitPlugin</Link>
and RabbitConnect are the drivers for the board tell the OS how to handle the input from the board.

Of the programs DGT provides, <Link href='http://www.livechesscloud.com/software/' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">LiveChess</Link> is the most interesting.  It is
used to manage the output of one or more e-boards and how the PGN gets written to disk.  It also shows if there is a
connection issue with one of the boards. The output is in standard <Link href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">PGN</Link> format and can be fed
to a program for playback or a chess engine for analysis.

Pgn like this can be parsed using a chess library. Luckily there are many good free chess libraries on github for about
any language you would want to use.  The follow code samples will use <Link href='https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/blob/master/README.md' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">chess.js</Link>
and be written in javascript.  <Link href='https://github.com/boosungkim/python-chess' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">python-chess</Link> is a great choice for python
coders and is even more feature rich than chess.js.  Both of these are able to parse the chess game and convert it into
objects you can use to do whatever!

To show off chess.js let's write a quick script that will display each move of this game from beginning to end.  This
script will require <Link href='https://nodejs.org/en/' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">node.js</Link> to be installed
and that's how we'll run it from the command line.  We'll also configure Livechess enough so that it writes a pgn to
disk.  Our code will poll this file and print its contents.  We can even get fancy and only print the broad if we have
detected changes since the last time we polled the board.

First steps are to plug in the board and start up LiveChess.  As long as the board shows up on one of the COM ports you
are good to go.  Then create a new tournament using the option under the file menu and select that new tournament.  When you select
this tournament some tabs will appear and start by filling out tournament information and player information.  These values
will be used in the PGN's header.

Next move to the Output tab.  The gear button in the lower righthand side will give you the output to write the output
to the cloud or to write it to some location on disk.  Select the Export to filesystem option and a window will appear.  If
your parser can handle e-pgn you may want it.  <Link target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.enpassant.dk/chess/palview/enhancedpgn.htm">ePGN</Link>
has a few extra fields that are useful for live games like time on play but for what we're doing here we don't need it.
Finally head to the round tab and add some players to your round.  Select the round then click the gear in the
lower right corner.  When you're ready hit start recording!

Once you hit that start recording button a new link recording will appear on the same row as the round that you can click
like a hyperlink.  This takes you two a new window that shows the state of the board.  With every new move that is play the
move will be written to the pgn file to disk.

Now that we have a file on disk we can start thinking about nodejs and the code we want to write that will for now
simply display an ascii representation of the board each time a new move is played.  Simply put we want to check this
file on an interval, let's say once a second, and if we notice that there are more moves than the last time we checked
it we want to display the board.  There are some methods in <Link href="https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js">chess.js</Link> that will be useful for this

* <Link href="https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/#load_pgnpgn--options-">load_pgn(pgn, [ options ])</Link> loads the pgn file into the library
* <Link href="https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/#ascii">.ascii()</Link> is used to display the board
* <Link href="https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/#pgn-options-">.pgn([ options ])</Link> returns the PGN as a string

As long as node is installed we are good to get started.  The first thing we want to do is make a new directory for our project.
In that directory run a `npm init` and enter through the questions.  The run `npm install --save chess.js` to install the
chess library and put it in our package.json file.  Add `"name": "pgn-dgt-example"` to the package.json file as well so that
we can use import instead of require(). The following code will do the trick.

    import {Chess} from 'chess.js'
    import fs from 'fs'

    let chess = new Chess()
    let inputFile = "C:\\Users\\lakeo\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\chess\\round-1\\game-1.pgn"

    let loadFile = (inputFile) => {
        chess.load_pgn(fs.readFileSync(inputFile, {encoding: "utf8"}))
    }

    let checkFile = (lastPgn, inputFile) => {
        loadFile(inputFile)
        let pgn = chess.pgn()
        if (lastPgn !== pgn) {
            console.log(chess.ascii())
        }
        setTimeout(() => checkFile(pgn, inputFile), 1000)
    }

    loadFile(inputFile)
    console.log(chess.ascii())
    checkFile(chess.pgn(), inputFile)
