Do you like chess?  I'm not any good at it, but I do enjoy watching a good chess game.
Nowadays, it's easy to find good chess online.  Big tournaments are streamed and include ESPN level
commentary.  Over the summer I faithfully tracked the games of the <Link href='https://grandchesstour.org/' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Grand Chess Tour</Link>
and was not disappointed.  Watching all of this good chess got me thinking about the data behind a chess game and
how that data can be used to do cool things.
